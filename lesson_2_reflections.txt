What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It makes a new hidden .git folder.  Also a .DS_store file, for some reason.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area lets you choose what files are involved in a commit.  This lets the commit be a cohesive unit.
